### What is Artificial Intelligence?:
```
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. 
```

### What is Machine Learning?:
```
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer 
systems that learn from data. The broad range of techniques ML encompasses enables software 
applications to improve their performance over time.
```

### What is deep learning?:
```
Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates 
the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep learning models can be taught to perform 
classification tasks and recognize patterns in photos, text, audio and other various data. 
It is also used to automate tasks that would normally need human intelligence, 
such as describing images or transcribing audio files.
```

### What is Supervised Machine Learning?:
```
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using 
well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. 
The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as 
the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. 
It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.
```

### What is Unsupervised Learning?:
```
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained 
using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.
```

### What is Semi-Supervised Learning?:
```
Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that represents 
the intermediate ground between Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms. 
It uses the combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.
```

### What is Reinforcement Learning?:
```
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent 
learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. 
For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, 
the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.

In Reinforcement Learning, the agent learns automatically using feedbacks without any 
labeled data, unlike supervised learning.

Since there is no labeled data, so the agent is bound to learn by its experience only.
```

### What is the Classification Algorithm?:
```
The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify 
the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, 
a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies 
new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, 
Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.
```

### What is Regression analysis?:
```
Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between 
a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more 
independent variables. More specifically, Regression analysis helps us to understand 
how the value of the dependent
variable is changing corresponding to an independent variable when other independent 
variables are held fixed. It predicts continuous/real values 
such as temperature, age, salary, price, etc.
```

### What is Clustering in Machine Learning?
```
Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. 
It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, 
consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities 
remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."
```
