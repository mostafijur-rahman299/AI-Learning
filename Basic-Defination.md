### What is Artificial Intelligence?:
```
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. 
```

### What is Machine Learning?:
```
Machine Learning, often abbreviated as ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) 
that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data. In simpler terms, machine learning enables 
computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly 
programmed to do so.
```

### What is deep learning?:
```
Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates 
the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep learning models can be taught to perform 
classification tasks and recognize patterns in photos, text, audio and other various data. 
It is also used to automate tasks that would normally need human intelligence, 
such as describing images or transcribing audio files.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning that teaches computers to perform tasks by 
learning from examples, much like humans do. Imagine teaching a computer to 
recognize cats: instead of telling it to look for whiskers, ears, and a tail, 
you show it thousands of pictures of cats. The computer finds the common patterns all 
by itself and learns how to identify a cat. This is the essence of deep learning.

In technical terms, deep learning uses something called "neural networks," which are inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process information. The more layers, the "deeper" the network, allowing it to learn more complex features and perform more sophisticated tasks.

### What is Supervised Machine Learning?:
```
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using 
well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. 
The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as 
the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. 
It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.
```

### What is Unsupervised Learning?:
```
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that learns from unlabeled data. 
This means that the data does not have any pre-existing labels or categories. 
The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover patterns and relationships 
in the data without any explicit guidance.

Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor 
labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task 
of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, 
and differences without any prior training of data. 

Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be 
given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure 
in unlabeled data by itself. 
```

### What is Semi-Supervised Learning?:
```
Semi-Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that represents 
the intermediate ground between Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms. 
It uses the combination of labeled and unlabeled datasets during the training period.
```

### What is Reinforcement Learning?:
```
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent 
learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. 
For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, 
the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.

In Reinforcement Learning, the agent learns automatically using feedbacks without any 
labeled data, unlike supervised learning.

Since there is no labeled data, so the agent is bound to learn by its experience only.
```

### What is the Classification Algorithm?:
```
The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique that is used to identify 
the category of new observations on the basis of training data. In Classification, 
a program learns from the given dataset or observations and then classifies 
new observation into a number of classes or groups. Such as, Yes or No, 0 or 1, 
Spam or Not Spam, cat or dog, etc. Classes can be called as targets/labels or categories.
```

### What is Regression analysis?:
```
A regression analysis means you are estimating the relationship between 
a dependent variable and one or multiple independent variables based on the information at hand.

You will look at the information in front of you, figure out what function 
matches the data most closely, and then use that function to fill in gaps in the data set.

If you think there is missing data, you will interpolate the missing data based on 
the regression function. Or, if you want to estimate future information that is 
outside of the current range, you will extrapolate to get that information.

Machine learning can use regression to help you find the right function based on 
the data in front of you. Then, you can use machine learning to expand your 
data set or fill in any gaps that might be present. That is where machine 
learning regression can be helpful.
```

### What is Clustering in Machine Learning?
```
Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. 
It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, 
consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities 
remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."
```
